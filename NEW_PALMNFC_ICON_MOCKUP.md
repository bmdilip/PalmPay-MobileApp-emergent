## 📱 Mockup Screenshots

### 1. **Home Page - Palm ID Section**
The new icon appears in the "Your Palm ID" section in the collapsible header:
- ✅ Icon now shows the beautiful teal circular design
- ✅ Perfectly integrates with the purple gradient background
- ✅ White palm and NFC waves clearly visible
- ✅ Maintains proper sizing and positioning

**Location:** `/home` - Top section, Palm ID card

---

### 2. **Services Page - Central Palm Hub**
The icon is NOT visible in the Services page because it navigates to "All Services" page instead. The central palm hub would be on the main services overview page.

**Note:** The Services page shows individual service icons in a grid layout, not the central palm hub.

### 3. **Onboarding Page - Palm Scan Animation**
The new icon appears during the palm scanning animation:
- ✅ Shows scanning progress (97%)
- ✅ Teal circular icon with palm and NFC waves
- ✅ Animated scanning effect overlay
- ✅ "Scanning palm..." status text

**Location:** `/` (root) - First slide "What is PalmPay?"
